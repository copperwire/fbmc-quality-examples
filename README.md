You can run the project on Binder, but it is much better to host this notebook yourself.
To start you need to download data from ENTSOE-transparency and JAO: 

- [Download ZIP file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rvMyY_A3YfbiNLWdRKmVVmAijUzBeMTn/view?usp=drive_link)

This zip file must be extracted to your home folder. It will create a folder `~/.flowbased_data` of cached data from the sources.

Afterwards, you need to make a virtual environment (preferrably with `python=3.10`) and install
